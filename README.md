## SPACE-R springboot backend

#Second project of java advanced branch: Spring boot backend

The goal of this project is to implement a Spring-Boot backend and connect it with our React frontend, so that it will service the front end.

The repository of the React SPACE-r app can be found here: https://github.com/dmvktr/space-r-react

The general requirements of the project:

* design and implement the backend part of the project with API design and business logic
* design and implement the frontend part of the project with multiple routes and fetching from backend API using React
* both of them should go to different GitHub repos 
* Use Spring Boot
* Use dependency injection
* Write unit tests for business logic, and use mock objects for testing classes with dependencies
* Push all code to GitHub, someone should create both repos and others can join!
